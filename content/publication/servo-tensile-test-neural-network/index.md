# Abstract.
abstract: "As a new type of third-generation automotive steel with high strength and plasticity, medium-Mn steel (MMnS)
has been widely used in automotive industries for its excellent properties. In recent years, servo stamping technology
for high-strength metal forming is a hot topic due to its good performance in forming under complex
processing conditions, and servo parameters determine the forming quality. In this paper, experiments considering 
tensile speed and position where speed changes (PSC) were carried out on MMnS to investigate the influences of 
tensile parameters on mechanical properties including strength and total elongation (TE). The results show that PSC
does not significantly impact total elongation. Initial tensile speed (ITS) and final tensile speed (FTS) significantly
impact the total elongation. The interaction between all tensile parameters can impact total elongation. Two artificial
neuralnetworks, back propagation neural network (BPNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), were used to
establish analytical models. The results of supplemental experiment and residual analysis were conducted to verify the
accuracy of the analytical models. The BPNN has a better performance and the analytical model shows that with the
increase of PSC, it has a slight impact on the changes of optimal and minimum total elongation, but the combinations of tensile parameters to obtain total elongations higher than 40% change significantly.
